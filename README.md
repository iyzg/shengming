# 生命 

A work-in-progress time tracker to help me keep track of what bottles the fleeting sands of time fall into.

This is to gain a perspective on where the broad strokes of my life go: areas (social, work, school, etc.), happiness,
and I'm planning on adding an arbitrary score for "productivity" or something along those lines.
